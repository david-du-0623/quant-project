# quant-project
This is a repository of my projects on quantitative finance. I am a rising thrid-year at University of Chicago majoring in statistics, and I am very interested in quantitative finance. Feel free to discuss any projects and the market with me! I am mostly easily reached at dufang0623@uchicago.edu.

The first one is my latest and most proud piece for final project of graduate-level "Regression Analysis and Quantitative Trading Strategies"(FINM 33150) class.
It is a Directional Change-based trading strategy on foreign currency portfolio. I implemented two versions of the strategy with fixed and dynamic threshold respectively. The highlight of strategy involves using implied sortino ratio in the training period to update the weights allocated to different currency pairs in my portfolio.
